# ofxARKit Face Tracking Example!

Requires [iOS OpenFrameworks 0.10.0](https://openframeworks.cc/download/) & [ofxARKit]

This project utilizes ofxARKit and ofxiOS. Using the iPhone's front-facing camera, the subject's face is tracked and then overlayed with a 'face filter'. The filter is produced using an ofMesh and utilizes both a fragment and vertex shader, written in GLSL.
